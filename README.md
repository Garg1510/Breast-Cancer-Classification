# Breast-Cancer-Classification

This repository contains a neural network implementation for classifying breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

Key Steps
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded, cleaned, and split into training and testing sets.
Model Training:
Logistic Regression: A baseline model is created to assess performance.
Artificial Neural Network (ANN): A neural network is built with multiple hidden layers to improve classification accuracy.
Performance Evaluation: Both models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Performance
Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of around 92% 
ANN: Outperformed Logistic Regression with an accuracy of around 95% 
The ANN demonstrated better performance, showcasing the effectiveness of neural networks in complex classification tasks.
