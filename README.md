# Breast-Cancer-Classification

This repository contains a neural network implementation for classifying breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

Key Steps:

1) Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded, cleaned, and split into training and testing sets.

2) Model Training:

Logistic Regression: A baseline model is created to assess performance.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN): A neural network is built with multiple hidden layers to improve classification accuracy.

3) Performance Evaluation: Both models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy both training and testing.

4) Performance:

Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of around 92% 

ANN: Outperformed Logistic Regression with an accuracy of around 95% 

The ANN demonstrated better performance, showcasing the effectiveness of neural networks in complex classification tasks.
